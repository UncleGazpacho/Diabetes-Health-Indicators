## Installation 

Before you begin, you'll need to ensure that you have the following software and libraries installed on your local machine:
* Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using data from the CDC's BRFSS 2015 to better understand:

* Data at a Glance: Mean, Gender, and Diabetes Types
* What are the key demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals with diabetes?
* How does diabetes relate to the occurrence of other health conditions?
* What are the various ways in which diabetes can impact a personâ€™s quality of life?

The primary goal of this project is to explore a dataset and apply data science techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. The motivation behind this project is to gain hands-on experience with real-world data, build practical data science skills, and demonstrate your proficiency in the data science field. The exploration process can lead to valuable insights that may be useful in various domains.

## File Descriptions 

In this project, you will find the following files:

* README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
* Jupyter Notebook: The main file for the exploration and analysis. I used this to interact with the dataset, perform data manipulations, and create visualizations.
* Dataset Files: A CSV file containing the data to be analysed.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the blogpost available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yannick.gorda/unraveling-the-diabetes-dilemma-a-journey-through-data-572a804f2d2e).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to CDC and Kaggle for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
